title: Request For Teachers
---

I believe that the RFT should be approached from the "problem" angle. 
Meaning the teachers should be reaching for a RFT whenever they see a problem.
Here are some examples off the top of my head.

Real ones mentioned:
- Some of my students have a hard time coming up with compelling copywriting for their product launch
- Some of my students don't really know how to brand themselves and their talents
- Some of my students find governance in social studies very dry

Fake ones I came up with:
- Some of my students find text based programming hard to understand
- Some of my students want to learn how to use the laser printer but don't know how to
- Some of my students can't seem to find the interest in math

# My data collection approach
Should i get the teachers to write RFTs first? 
- Yes. It's because RFTs will definitely be achieved. I'll see to it.

How should I approach the people in my batch?
- First ask them if they would be willing to teach if asked to do so
- Ask them fill up the profile
- Next show them the RFS.
    - If yes, send them workshop proposal
    - If no, ask them if they have any particular ideas they would have


What will you get out of this?
- It will be an official initiative. Volunteer basis.
- In the future, if you're representing your company, maybe can claiim CSR.
