# Turtles all the Way Down

## What are fractals?

A fractal is **a never-ending pattern**. Fractals are infinitely complex patterns that are self-similar across different scales. They are created by repeating a simple process over and over in an ongoing feedback loop.

## Today’s learning objective

Leave class today with a greater appreciation of how does nature solve complex problems with simple rules.

## Why should I learn this?

- Computer graphics
    - It's not just about generating beautiful abstract images, but realistic and not repeating landscapes. Read about [Fractal Landscapes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractal_landscape).

- Cancer
    - It turns out that this is [used in biology and medicine](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010465508004190) to analyze cell samples, for example, analyze how aggressive a cancer cell is, or how far a disease have gone. A cell is in general more healthy the higher the dimension is, meaning you wish for low fractal dimension for cancer samples.

    - There is a direct correlation between fractal dimension and complexity (or chaos), which is why it detects cancer -- the branching of the veins and arteries is haphazard in a cancer, chaotic because the cancer grows too fast to grow in an orderly fashion.
- Antenna
    - The typically self-similar nature of fractals is also helpful in creating and operating antennas. Curves like the Hilbert curve can be used to design high-performance and low-profile antennas. When they are combined with EM radiation concepts, multi-band antennas can also be operated. [Read more here](https://www.intechopen.com/chapters/54899).

## Activity 1: Shapes with functions

{% include figure image_path="assets/lib/turtles/Untitled%206.png" alt=""  %}


Activity: Draw some basic shapes with the turtle program. (Square, Circle, Star)

Turtle Commands:
```
fw 100 = Forward steps

rt 45 = turn right 45 degrees

lt 30 = turn left 30 degrees

jmp 100 = Move forward 100 steps without drawing anything

for 3 (function) = Do the function 3 times.
```

## Activity 2: Koch snowflake

Activity: Draw a Koch snowflake

## Activity 3: Your own snowflake

Activity: Go crazy and make your own snowflake! Think about which of the properties you can change and how that affects your snowflake.

## Activity 4: Inversion!
