# My data collection approach
Should i get the teachers to write RFTs first? 
- Yes. It's because RFTs will definitely be achieved. I'll see to it.

How should I approach the people in my batch?
- First ask them if they would be willing to teach if asked to do so
- Ask them fill up the profile
- Next show them the RFS.
    - If yes, send them workshop proposal
    - If no, ask them if they have any particular ideas they would have


What will you get out of this?
- It will be an official initiative. Volunteer basis.
- In the future, if you're representing your company, maybe can claiim CSR.
