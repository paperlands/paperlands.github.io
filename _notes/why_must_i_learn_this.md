## “Why” matters

“Why must I learn this?"<br>
I always asked this question as a kid. <br>
The common replies are:<br>
- "I don't really know"
- “Because it’s tested in the exam"
- "Just do it, you will understand why next time"
- “You will use it next year if you take X subject”

Honestly, these answers never really satisfied my curiosity.<br>
Soon I stopped asking why.<br>
Eventually I just followed mindlessly along.<br>

Though, that nagging feeling that something was off always stayed with me.<br>
Something about school just doesn’t quite resonate with real life.<br>

Now that I’m out of the system, I understand what’s missing.<br>
The difference between learning in school vs learning in real life.<br>
In school, we are often taught concepts just-in-case (JIC) we need it.<br>
- We study the Hooke's law just-in-case (JIC) we need it.
- We study Shakespeare’s poems just-in-case (JIC) we need it.
- We study the structures of a benzene ring just-in-case (JIC) we need it.

“Just in case we need it” alone is a poor reason for learning.<br>
That’s why I’ve forgotten most of these things!<br>
My excuse is I have no reason to keep these concepts in my brain.<br>
It’s poor because most people stop learning after they exit the system!<br>

In real life, we have no time to learn things just-in-case.<br>
We need better ways to learn something new!<br>
Better WHYs, WHEN and HOW we learn.<br>

In real life,<br>
- we search youtube and learn about suspension springs just-in-time to fix that faulty bicycle.<br>
- we research companies and learn to write a compelling title just-in-time for our product launch.<br>
- we search wiki and learn about aromatic compounds just-in-time to make our custom perfume gift.<br>

In real life, learning always takes place in the context of an application.<br>
“Why” we need this concept, this piece of knowledge, comes BEFORE the actual learning.<br>
Learning is done just-in-time (JIT), not just-in-case (JIC)!<br>

I believe that the “why” is largely missing in today’s education system.<br>
Without it, the beauty of learning is lost.<br>
We leave our schools less curious than when we started.<br>

That’s why I believe that the future of education needs to better address the “why”.<br>


# Two parters

{% margin %}
"Context is worth 80 IQ points" ~ Alan Kay
{% endmargin %}

Understanding “why” has 2 parts.<br>
Past context and present context.<br>

First, a student needs to understand the CONTEXT in which a concept was formed in the PAST.<br>
For example, let’s look at housing policies concepts.<br>
What problems were the policy makers trying to solve?<br>
What tools did they have at hand?<br>
What were their hidden incentives?<br>
Half the battle is won just by understanding why the concept existed to begin with.<br>

Second, the students need to understand how that CONTEXT relates to their PRESENT world.<br>
Drawing similarities between context of the past and the context of today.<br>
Adapting and moulding the concept to apply it for themselves.<br>
Through this practice, we can see a true mark of mastery, and a clear demonstration of a complete understanding of <br>“WHY I learned this”.<br>



# Poorly positioned

Achieving the first part is not easy.<br>
Teachers that do that well are hard to come by.<br>

Achieving the second part appears to be even more challenging.<br>

Why?<br>
Teachers are not positioned to do it well!<br>
They are not blessed with the opportunity to put these ideas into practice and see it through to execution.<br>
To wrestle with all aspects of the idea as it clashes head on with the messy nature of reality,<br>
and developing deep appreciation for the idea through that experience.<br>
That’s the job of a practitioner of the craft, not a school teacher.<br>

We know this.<br>
Business teachers love to invite big business owners to the classroom.<br>
Physics teachers love to invite engineers to the classroom.<br>
Basketball coaches love to invite NBA players to the lockerroom.<br>

Teachers value the PRESENT CONTEXT these industry professionals bring.<br>
Their experiences showcase how concepts apply to the real world,<br>
bringing relevance to the material students study,<br>
inspiring the students to learn.<br>
They are better positioned to answer the second part.<br>


# Untapped potential

What if engineers, doctors, designers, leaders were invited into the classrooms.<br>

To share the things they put into practice which they find interesting.<br>
To share the contexts of the big problems they are solving.<br>
To share the motivations behind their learning.<br>

So that students walk away <br>
knowing what they are chasing,<br>
knowing where they are heading,<br>
knowing why they are learning.<br>

Why wouldn't that be wonderful?<br>
