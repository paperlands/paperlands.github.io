# Turtles all the Way Down

# Today’s learning objective

Leave class today with a greater appreciation of how does nature solve complex problems with simple rules.

# Nature!

Initially, these appear like highly complex shapes – but when you look closer, you might notice that they both follow a relatively simple pattern: all the individual parts of the plants look exactly the same as the entire plant, just smaller. The same pattern is repeated over and over again, at smaller scales.

In mathematics, we call this property **self-similarity**, and shapes that have it are called **fractals**

A **fractal** is a geometric shape that has a *fractional dimension*. Many famous fractals are *self-similar*, which means that they consist of smaller copies of themselves. Fractals contain patterns at every level of magnification, and they can be created by repeating a procedure or iterating an equation infinitely many times.

. They are some of the most beautiful and most bizarre objects in all of mathematics.

# Our Own Fractals

To create our own fractals, we have to start with a simple pattern and then repeat it over and over again, at smaller scales.

# Activity 1: Shapes with functions

Activity: Draw some basic shapes with the turtle program. (Square, Circle, Star)

Turtle Commands:

fw 100 = Forward steps

rt 45 = turn right 45 degrees

lt 30 = turn left 30 degrees

jmp 100 = Move forward 100 steps without drawing anything

for 3 (function) = Do the function 3 times.

# Activity 2: Koch snowflake

Activity: Draw a Koch snowflake

# Activity 3: Your own snowflake

Activity: Go crazy and make your own snowflake! Think about which of the properties you can change and how that affects your snowflake.

# Activity 4: Inversion!

# Why should I learn this?

- Computer graphics
    - It's not just about generating beautiful abstract images, but realistic and not repeating landscapes. Read about [Fractal Landscapes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractal_landscape).
        
- Cancer
    - It turns out that this is [used in biology and medicine](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010465508004190) to analyze cell samples, for example, analyze how aggressive a cancer cell is, or how far a disease have gone. A cell is in general more healthy the higher the dimension is, meaning you wish for low fractal dimension for cancer samples. You can think of it as how “rough” a cancer cell is.
    
        
    - There is a direct correlation between fractal dimension and complexity (or chaos), which is why it detects cancer -- the branching of the veins and arteries is haphazard in a cancer, chaotic because the cancer grows too fast to grow in an orderly fashion.
- Antenna
    - The typically self-similar nature of fractals is also helpful in creating and operating antennas. Curves like the Hilbert curve can be used to design high-performance and low-profile antennas. When they are combined with EM radiation concepts, multi-band antennas can also be operated. [Read more here](https://www.intechopen.com/chapters/54899).

# How is this Math x Computation?

Through giving the turtles commands, we are able to simulate and understand deeper about the nature of fractals. We can do so with just a few lines of code. To run all these commands in real life with a pen and paper would take an eternity. Compared to the  [[beginnings]] of computing, our devices of today we have drastically sped up the running of these commands. It allows us to visualise our theories and deepen our understanding of the world.
