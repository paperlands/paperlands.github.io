## Thinking

Thinking is often intertwined with the context within which we operate and apply them. Two of the greatest of such context have been writing and mathematical notation. These tools need not only be notational or symbolic. The human mind in the presence of an abacus for instance exploits it much like a scaffold around which to structure cognitive operations. Such objects adapt and extend the thoughts that run our human minds into the external world. Computational environments have in recent years been at the forefront of this process helping people and businesses reason about processes that they want to observe, intervene, model and share.

{% include figure image_path="assets/lib/kids.jpg" alt="" caption="Computational thinking is about formulating the thinking about processes with enough clarity, and in a systematic that it can be firstly understood by people, and only incidentally to the extent that it can tell even a computer what to do" %}

Computers are still however being ill treated as modes for instruction in class when in fact they are a far richer tool as modes for interaction. It is still the child and the paper and the teacher, just that the paper has been substituted for the screen. 

## Interacting

Every child can be expected to tactily be able to play around with blocks or wood or the paint brush but adding vectors or creating a tangent or formulating an exponential is thought out of their reach. That is because the only way traditionally to express these have been via pen and paper after what has been rigorous instruction. However with a computational environment {% margin %}Seymour Papert called this process the microworld where all childen engage in creation of little pockets of reality, where they grow a sense of bearing and footing to feel at home in with a piece of knowledge (say counting but in counting using hands world or using coins world etc.). He believed computers is the interactive tool through which the process of exploring these [microworlds](/assets/lib/microworlds.pdf){: .internal-link} suited for education becomes "a more natural and spontaneous one, similar to the way children learn language" {% endmargin %} interaction can take the place of instruction and a world of sheeps and wolves or of spreading wildfires can easily help kids play around with exponentials and decay simply by doing and manipulating simple parameters.

We need a process to support our thinking about other things around.[^1] Computation here is just a means of representation of just such a process - it is meant for trying  ideas out with it and get objective results as opposed to a situation where they could only think about it inside their heads, unable to bring those ideas out into the world and see the results. 

We believe that computers are a means to enlarge and extend the reach of human thought itself.



## Teaching


To cultivate that enables active learning the addressing the needs of the teacher is essential. It is they who can relate and touch the chords that resonates with the experiences of the learners in classroom. So the environment the teacher introduces to the classroom has to feel familiar to them and gain their confidence.

 Teachers need to feel confident in navigating through the context and in their capacity to contextualise learning through the tool. This would be in building the right scaffoldings for onramping teachers. Classrooms time which would be the most fruitful of time to conduct such exploratory learning also happen to be the most scarce. We need to facilitate their their ability to moor the class and intervene with confidence when needed be it in showcasing one of the learners work or in debugging a gap in the mental picture of a student.
 
We believe that teaching computation should enable a lively process of co-discovery between teachers and students. 
 


## Together
  

The learner is most consciously engaged when building something in the open with others, whether it's a sand castle on the beach or clamping lego bricks together. They look over each others shoulder, push around what their friends have done, try to copy what others are doing, build something a bit different from what others are doing, pick up half an idea here and another half somewhere else, show off what they have done in their own way, express what they are trying to get at. Notice you can view these activities through the eyes of a child but read it again through the eyes of a seasoned software developer and it remains the same. 

The colloborative, cooperative and competitive behavior is what drives and brings momentum in learning everything from sports to music. Why then is it in programming intro class is setting up an shell/ide/platform you use on your own or many students sharing one screen to simulate live group thinking? Any online multiplayer game seems to have a better idea what it means to colloborate to achieve shared objectives in realtime than what we have in computing so far. Seasoned programmers fall on purposeful asynchronous collaborative tools such as Git to achieve shared goals but what is its equivalent in a synchronous live classroom setting? 

We believe that learning computation should spur the spirit of conviviality and camraderie in us just as in any street sport would.



## Aims

1. Bring people together in discovering the joy of the world through computation
2. Vitalise teachers to introduce computation into their classrooms
3. Create a realtime multiplayer computational authoring context that respects the space of learning
4. Place human agency in the forefront of aforementioned learning process

These are the fourfold goals that we will achieve in Paperland
